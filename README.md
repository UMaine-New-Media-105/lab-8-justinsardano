The Github tasks we did during lab in lab 8. I was sick and missed this lab, and have over time been trying to figure out how to do the tasks given. I searched some Youtube videos on how to do certain things, and I believe I've done it to the best of my abilities. Sorry for turning it in so late, I've been busy over the past couple of weeks.
